## Description
This is a very simple and basic tool that helps in measuring distance [using a rotary encoder ] and also knows the heading reference/orientation via an IMU sensor[MPU-6050].

So that's it.

## Further Scope
For now, our devices only measure 2D space, but we can use them to measure 3D space [the last thing humanity needs to be done is measure 3D space using this tool ]

But some major development that can be added or contributed(ðŸ¥²) are :
1. Restructuring the control flow in the main.py[software side]
2. Changes in many/every function.
3. Not using the software in the first place [it was built so that we feel we did something], displaying all the metrics in a separate display[I2C]/the hardware itself.
4. Adding a pointer/sight/reference to help the user holding it know where to start and stop.
5. Using a better IMU Sensor, we are using MPU6050 on top with DMP, so there is a significant yaw drift[we had only one thing to do ðŸ˜”].
6. Using a hall effect sensor, instead of a rotary encoder[we just went with the flow, although we knew it was coming].
7. Closing the project and not working on stupid ideas,[but it can be efficient if made in a very small form factor]. 

## Still It Gets the Job Done ðŸ”¥ :
Although it has some limitations, it does work and works fine.

It gives the following output to the user:
* Distance
* Displacement
* Area
* X and Y axis Displacement 

Although, it is very easy after we get the two points[start and end].

## I tried to change the Form-Factor
### [Do not mind the HC-05(Bluetooth 2.0) connected to Arduino Nano RP2040 which already has a BLE 5.0]
